The concept of User Experience (UX) is essential in website design as it affects users' perception of a website's value. UX refers to the experiences that users have while interacting with websites and products. The better the UX, the higher the productivity and user satisfaction, and the lower the support and maintenance costs. A perfect UX allows users to process information better, making it easier for them to follow through with purchasing products. In contrast, a poor UX could cause frustration and lead to users abandoning the website. To achieve a good UX, it is necessary to spend time on ideas, strategies, planning, and teamwork. Additionally, research is required to understand who the users are and what they need. By doing so, the website can be designed to meet the user's expectations, leading to better productivity and user satisfaction. Finally, optimizing the system can result in reduced support and maintenance costs, making it easier to scale up the company. The investment in UX design may be time-consuming, but the benefits of having a good UX are significant in the long term.
