## Becoming a software developer from zero involves the following steps:

1. **Choose a programming language**: There are many programming languages, but it's recommended to start with an easy-to-learn language like **Python** or **JavaScript**.

1. **Learn the basics**: Start with the fundamentals of programming like **data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes**.

1. **Practice coding**: Start coding simple programs and gradually move on to more complex ones. You can find coding challenges online or work on your own projects.

1. **Learn a framework or library**: Many software developers use frameworks or libraries to simplify their work. For example, if you're interested in web development, you can learn a front-end framework like **React**, **Angular** or **Vue**.

1. **Build a portfolio**: Create a portfolio of your projects to showcase your skills to potential employers. For example: https://nvimai.com

1. **Network with other developers**: Attend tech events, join online communities, and connect with other developers. This can help you learn new skills, get feedback on your work, and find job opportunities. For examples: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/).

1. **Consider getting a degree or certification**: Although it's not necessary to have a degree or certification to become a software developer, it can help you learn the necessary skills and make you stand out to employers.

1. Remember, becoming a software developer **takes time and practice**. Keep learning and building projects, and you'll eventually become a skilled developer.
