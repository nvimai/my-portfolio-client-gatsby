## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Using Gatsby CLI**
    ```sh
    npm i -g gatsby-cli
    ```
1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    ```sh
    # Using git clone to create new site based on My Portfolio source
    gatsby new my-portfolio https://github.com/nvimai/nvimai-gatsby-netlify
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new portfolio siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

### Overview of core technologies
* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Gatsby use it as framework to build pages, components and structure content.
* **GraphQL:** A query language built by Facebook which allows to pull data into website. Gatsby use it as interface for managing site data.

### Gatsby files
* **gatsby-config.js:** defines your siteâ€™s metadata, plugins, and other general configuration. This file should be in the root of your Gatsby site.
* **gatsby-node.js:** is run once in the process of building your site. You can use it to create pages dynamically, add nodes in GraphQL, or respond to events during the build lifecycle. 
* **gatsby-browser.js:** lets you respond to actions within the browser, and wrap your site in additional components. The Gatsby Browser API gives you many options for interacting with the client-side of Gatsby.
* **gatsby-ssr.js:** lets you alter the content of static HTML files as they are being Server-Side Rendered (SSR) by Gatsby and Node.js. 
### Gatsby Pages
* Every JS, JSX file inside the <code>/src/pages/</code> are **React Components** and they will automatically become a page. e.i. <code>index.js</code> is **Home Page**

### Gatsby Component
* It is **React Component**
* Gatsby pages are **React Components**
### Linking between pages
* Use ```<Link to="" />``` component to direct to other internal pages.
* ```import { Link } from "gatsby"``` before using.
### Gatsby blugins
* Markdown: ```gatsby-plugin-mdx```
* Sass: ```gatsby-plugin-sass```
* PWA: ```gatsby-plugin-offline```
